# Project 2 - Nessst
This project is near and dear to me, as it was my BFA project back in 2012. Around this time, Responsive Web Design was fairly new. It wasn't something that was taught at EWU, and I had to teach myself how to make everything work. Technology has come a long way. It took me 6 months to build this project. 

You have a week and a half.  

The difference between then, and now, is that you have Allan and myself to help you. This is an extension of the Flexbox exercises that we did in class, with slight variations. 

## Getting Started
Open the "Design" folder. It contains two folders: "compositions" and "wireframes". Use the images within these folders to create the two pages for this assignment. 

## Content
Pull content from the images as necessary, however, for the "Student Detail" page, put your information in, including your work. 

## Requirements
Fork this repsitory and commit your work to your new repo. You will need to create two responsive pages: 
* Home
* Student Detail

Follow the design as closely as possible. 

## Submission
Submit your live link to Canvas.
